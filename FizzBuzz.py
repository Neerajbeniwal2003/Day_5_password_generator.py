#You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
#  These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:
#Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.

#But when the number is divisible by 3 
# then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

#When the number is divisible by 5,
# then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 
# then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

for i in range(1,101):
    if i%3==0 and i%5==0:
        print("fizzbuzz")
    elif i%5==0:
        print("buzz")
    elif i%3==0:
        print("fizz")
    else:
        print(i)
#simple as that
